/**
 *  @brief `ADAppRater` is a component intended to help you promote your apps in the App Store by targeting satisfied users and asking them to rate your app.
 *  @discussion `ADAppRater` requires no configuration and can perform as is, simply using default configuration and the application's current plist details.
 *  Configuring custom values for the parameter is optional, and recommended to do so before the app has finished launching, i.e. in the AppDelegate's `application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.
